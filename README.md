Problem Statement
The HR department is responsible for monitoring and managing various aspects of employee data to ensure a healthy workforce. However, 
there is a lack of clear performance indicators (KPIs) to track and analyze key HR metrics effectively. Without a structured approach, 
decision-making processes become inefficient, and strategic workforce planning is hindered.

To address this challenge, I have developed an HR Analytics Dashboard that provides key insights into workforce dynamics using Power BI,
SQL, and Excel. The dashboard focuses on the following core HR metrics:

Employee Count – The organization lacks visibility into its total workforce size, making it difficult to plan for growth or downsizing.
Attrition Count – A standardized method to track employee exits is missing, leading to incomplete and unreliable data on turnover.
Attrition Rate – Without a clear attrition rate, the organization struggles to assess overall turnover levels and benchmark against industry standards.
Departmental Breakdown – There is no structured way to analyze workforce distribution and attrition across different departments.
Diversity Metrics – The company lacks insights into workforce diversity, affecting efforts to build an inclusive work environment.
This project aims to solve these issues by designing a data-driven HR analytics solution that enables informed decision-making and strategic workforce planning.
